# Pacman

Pacman game in Java.</br>
The game was written by me back in 2009 when I was studying in University.</br>
It uses pathfinding Lee algorithm to find the closest path from ghost(enemy) to pacman(player). 

**There are two main parts:** </br>
_Level Editor_ that looks like this:

</br>and</br>
_Pacman game_ itself:

**Controls:**</br>
Arrows  &nbsp; ↑, ←, ↓, → &nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp; w,a,s,d
